Third place in the Code 4 Cal Hackathon.

Time: 10/26/14 - 10 hrs

iPhone app designed to allow students to broadcast and find current study groups.

Should work out of the box. The layout is optimized for iPhone 4 retina simulator and ios 7.0.

Uses built.io for the backend.

Features
---------------------
  - Login/Registration though Built.io
  - Add/Remove classes with search bar and table view
  - Create a study group and specify and address that gets converted to lat/long
  - Show all study groups in a table or map view
  - basic messaging

TODO
----------------------
  - Allow login through berkeley calnet so we can pull the students course schedule automatically
  - Show only relevant study groups.  I.e. in the course, location nearby
  - Handle notifications/iBeacon
  - Make messaging within specific groups rather than global
